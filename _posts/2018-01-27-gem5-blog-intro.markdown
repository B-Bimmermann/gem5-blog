There is a lot of knowledge that is lost in the [gem5][gem5] community.
Many of us working on [gem5][gem5] primarily use it during while we are pursing a graduate degree.
Unfortunately, after we receive that degree, we don't document *how* we conducted our research.

This blog give a platform for *informal* documentation on gem5.
Unlike the [wiki][gem5], this blog is more conversational and doesn't require specific categorization of posts.

Everyone in encouraged to contribute to this blog!
[Jason Lowe-Power](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/lowepower/) is the editor.
For now, email Jason ([jason@lowepower.com](mailto:jason@lowepower.com)) with blog post ideas and he will provide details on contributing.

This blog is on very generally about [gem5][gem5].
Examples of posts we are looking for are gem5 "best practices", examples of how you are using gem5, updates on recent gem5 changes, deep dives on how parts of gem5 work, and many many others.

We're looking forward to encouraging more participation from the community with this blog.
If you have ideas on how to improve it or other ways to use this space, don't hesitate to contact the editor (Jason Lowe-Power) at jason@lowepower.com.
